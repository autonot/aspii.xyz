# Hello. Welcome to ASPII.xyz!

My name is Ty, I'm a 19 year old college sophomore, and I like computers.

This is a repository that hosts the source code for my website. You can find it [here](https://aspii.xyz)

I have Asperger's syndrome.

This website isn't supposed to be anything "professional"...it's just something for me to work on in spare time.

This website was created on Hugo, a static site generator. More info is [here!](https://gohugo.io/)

A large majority of this site consists of posts formatted in Markdown. You'll find them in the `content` folder.

In addition to posts, I'll also, at some point put art and music on here, along with hosting free games. No boredom!

Feel free to send pull requests, yell at me over how bad the site is (actually don't do that >.<) and whatever else.

Thank you for checking it out!! :)
