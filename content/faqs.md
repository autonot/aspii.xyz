I have not been asked any of these questions, so making them FAQ's is really something. But in case you *did* have questions...

## How old are you?
19

## Why did you make this website?
Because I wanted something to do involving computers. I have tried to make a website in the past, but....

## How did you make this website?
I used Hugo, a static site generated written in the Go programming language. More info [here](https://gohugo.io/).
I had tried other site generators, such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/). But I like Hugo the most right now.
Soon, I'll make a tutorial on how I made this site.

## Why is "ASPII.xyz" the website name?
It's a play on words, combining ASCII, an [encoding standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), with *aspie*, a term used to describe somepone with Asperger's (aka me). The .xyz domain is nothing special.

## Where did the "Autonot" name come from?
When making an Xbox gamertag I wanted "auto" in my name for some reason. So that led to autonot. yeah i know it's not a great name but whatever.

## Is this a professional website?
Well...maybe. I try to be serious with the tutorials, but this is mostly a hobby I'm keeping up.

## This theme is ugly as hell why did you pick it?
I like it :angry:

## Are you responsible for keeping Arby's in business?
Perhaps...

## Is this website free?
Yes!! This website is 100% free to use. It has no ads, no tracking, no analytics, none of that.

## What projects (besides the website) are you currently working on?
Not much at the moment. I want to make art and music, and also explore more programming opportunities, such as different API's and making social media bots (not THOSE bots, though).

## Wawa or Sheetz?
Wawa.
