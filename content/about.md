# Hello, and welcome to my website!!!

Hi, my name is Ty. I'm a 19 year old college sophomore who's currently majoring in computer science.

I live near Philadelphia.

I love computers. I have been fascinated with them for a long time now.

So with this, I decided to make a semi-decent website (make is a strong word...)

# What will I find on this site?

This site will esentially have.....**things.**

These things will include various computer-related articles and tutorials.

Also will include games I may decided to host (or even make!!) and maybe some art/music (if I ever get around to that.)

# Ok, that's cool, now tell us about yourself.

Some of my interests (outside of computers of course) are...

* Programming (does that count as computers? i hope not)
* Watching movies
* Playing video games (I have a Steam account, if interested)
* Taking nice walks
* listening to music (I'm really into synthwave/chillwave/retrowave music :) I hope to make my own soon!)
* Visiting the boardwalk in summer
* Watching sports. Unfortunately, I'm a Philly sports fan, so it's a painful experience.

I have Asperger's, and it screws me over sometimes, so please be patient >.<


That's all for now. I hope you enjoy the website. Visit the FAQ's for more.
